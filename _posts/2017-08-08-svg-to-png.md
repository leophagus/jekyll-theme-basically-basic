SVG images look nice but unfortunately cannot be used with (not so) older versions of MS Powerpoint. No problem, we got ImageMagick right? So, heres what happenned when I converted an svg from the web:

![Default PNG]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bus.png)

The png image was tiny and resizing it in PPT made it terrible. Then I tried online convertors and they gave similar results. Maybe they are running *convert* as well :) SO suggested that I pass in a size option thusly: `convert -size 200x200 bus.svg bus.png`. No change with the result. 

The simplest SVG format [description] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Getting_Started) I found showed *width* and *height* defined in the header of the svg file. Added the same to my svg file and Voila!, a nicer looking png came out.

`<svg  fill="#000000" xmlns="ht`
`<svg width='400' height='400' fill="#000000" xmlns="ht`

![PNG from edited SVG]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bus2.png)

In theory, the `-size` option to convert should have done the same. Someday I will look into ImageMagick and find out why it ignored the -size option.
